# CyVerse

CyVerse supports an [:octicons-database-24: iRODS](https://irods.org){target=_blank} Data Store. iRODS allows you to organize object storage with additional metadata and sharing features, and can be used on commercial cloud storage or on public research storage.

We are hosting the derivative data on resource storage servers (physically located at University of Arizona on Sun Corridor connection and replicated at Texas Advanced Computing Center over Internet2).

These data can be accessed using iRODS [`iCommands`](https://docs.irods.org/master/icommands/user/){target=_blank} in the :octicons-terminal-24: command line interface, 3rd party consoles, or in the browser over `https://`.
